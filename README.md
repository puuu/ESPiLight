# ESPiLight

This Arduino library is a port of the [pilight](https://pilight.org/)
433.92MHz protocols to the Arduino platform. It was tested with a
ESP8266. The aim is to transmit, receive and parse many 433.92MHz
protocols, by providing a simple Arduino friendly API. This should
help to implement IoT bridges between the 434MHz-RF band and internet
protocols.

By porting the C modules of the pilight protocols, allows to
participate on the excellent work of the pilight community. Thus,
supporting many protocols for rc switches and weather stations without
reimplementing them.

A list of supported protocols can be found in the pilight wiki:
https://wiki.pilight.org/doku.php/protocols


## Installation

This library can be easily installed with the Arduino Library Manager.


## Usage

Please have a look to the examples.


### Requirements

This library was tested and developed for the
[ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino). It may not run on a
ATmega-based boards, because of memory usage.

For transmitting and receiving you need 434MHz-RF modules. More
information can be found here:

- https://wiki.pilight.org/doku.php/senders

## Contributing

If you find any bug, feel free to open an issue at github.  Also, pull
requests are welcome. The development takes place in the `master`
branch. The `release` is used to integrate the pilight files and for
version tagging, like necessary for the Arduino Library Manager
crawler.

To prevent formating issues, please make sure that your code is proper
formatted. We use the `clang-format` tool with the `Google` style.
You can just format the code by calling
```
$ clang-format -style=Google -i <source-file>
```


### Install from source

If you are interested to install this library from source, you need to
integrate the pilight source files. Since Arduino build all cpp/c
files in the src directory and sub directories, only necessary files
from pilight will be integrated.  This will be done with GNU make.

On Linux you can run:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/puuu/ESPiLight/
$ cd ESPiLight
$ make
$ ln -s `pwd` ~/Arduino/libraries/
```


#### Update

To update EPiLight from git run:
```console
$ git pull
$ make update
```


## Acknowledgement

Big thanks goes to the pilight community, which implemented all the
434MHz protocols. If you want to integrate more protocols, please
contribute directly to [pilight](https://pilight.org/).
